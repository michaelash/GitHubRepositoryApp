These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes:  
1)Add the project to your local iis(localhost is not working on my machine for now) <br />
2)In the main Web.config file under the appSettings section there is a 'baseUrl' key, change the value of this to your iis path of the project
